The atomic design system takes inspiration from chemistry. It consists of five distinct levels as follows:

Atoms: Building blocks of the project, they canâ€™t be broken down
Molecules: A group of atoms are grouped together that become new properties
Organisms: Group of molecules joined together to form a part of the interface
Templates: Mostly focused on content structure
Pages: Specific instances of templates
